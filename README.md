This project is the mobile app for the AlmostHere project. It's a transport app using GTFS data. It's only about one company for now, but intended to work with more transports companies/types.

It's a React Native CLI app. It's a project made for learning RN, so it's not intended to be used in production for now. It's project for my thesis.
